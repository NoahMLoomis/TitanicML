# TitanicML
### This Project uses machine learning with python to _guess_ if a person would survive on the titatic or not.
### It also displays three charts to display who actually died vs who survived based on a few factors



# Getting Started
### Navigate to the root and run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Run `python3 ./titatic.py`
### _There should be graphs that show up, but if they dont, figure it out_
